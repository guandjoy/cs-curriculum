# Computer Science Curriculum

Here is my plan that suppose to fill the gaps in programming and improve architecture of JS libraries I create.

## 1. C lang basics.

- [The C Programming Language by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hilder/cs833/Other%20Reference%20Materials/The%20C%20Programming%20Language.pdf)

- [Free interactive C tutorial](https://www.learn-c.org/)

## 2. C++ basics.

- [Free interactive C++ tutorial](https://www.learn-cpp.org/)

## 3. Data Structures and Algorithms. Java or Rust or Python.

## 4. Data Structures and Algorithms. Clojure.

## 5. Data Structures and Algorithms. Haskell.
