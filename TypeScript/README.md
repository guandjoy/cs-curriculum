## Data Structures

### Stack

A linear data structure that could be represented as a real physical stack. In JS could be implemented using standart array. It has two principal operations (methods):

- `push(value)`: add new value on top;
- `pop()`: removes top value.

### Set [[1]](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)>)

An unordered data structure that contains only unique values. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set. In my implementation it has next operations:

- `add(value)`;
- `remove(value)`;
- `has(value)`;
- `values()`;
- `union(setA, setB)`;
- `intersection(setA, setB)`;
- `difference(setA, setB)`;
- `subset(setA, setB)`.
