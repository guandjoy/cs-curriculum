# Computer Science Curriculum

Here is my plan that supposes to fill the gaps in programming and improve the architecture of JS libraries I create.

## 1. C lang.

The goal is to try a mid-level language.

- [The C Programming Language by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hilder/cs833/Other%20Reference%20Materials/The%20C%20Programming%20Language.pdf)

- [Free interactive C tutorial](https://www.learn-c.org/)

## 2. Rust.

I pick Rust over C++ and Java because of its modern infrastructure. It is easy to start to learn and play with.

- basics;
- data structures and algorithms

## 3. Racket

Racket is the most modern and comfortable way to start with Lisp. I thought about Clojure, but I don't want to install all that required. Plus, Clojure on Windows is in an alpha stage. But for sure, I should try ClojureScript.

I heard a lot of kind words about Lisp and as I saw it used by a lot of amazing companies. It has a unique history, and that is an entirely different way to program. So I want to have an opinion on that and understand why some people love it so much.

- basics;
- data structures and algorithms

## 4. Haskell

My goal is to learn hard parts of functional programming. Haskell, as a statically typed, purely functional programming language, is the perfect choice for that. I also consider PureScript, but after reading recommendations on Reddit, I concluded that Haskell is a bit better choice, because of the bigger ecosystem.

- data structures and algorithms
